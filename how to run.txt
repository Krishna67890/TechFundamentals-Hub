====================================

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Krishna67890/SQL-Learning-Website-Python-Development

This project is a full-stack application with a React frontend and Python Flask backend.
Follow these steps to run the application:

PREREQUISITES:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- Git (optional, for cloning)

BACKEND SETUP (Python Flask):
1. Open a command prompt/terminal
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   cd d:\KRISHNA\VS code\python\MySql Website\react-sql-website\backend
3. Install Python dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Start the backend server:
   python app.py
5. The backend will run on http://localhost:5001

FRONTEND SETUP (React):
1. Open another command prompt/terminal
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   cd d:\KRISHNA\VS code\python\MySql Website\react-sql-website\frontend
3. Install Node.js dependencies:
   npm install
4. Start the frontend development server:
   npm start
5. The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000

RUNNING THE APPLICATION:
1. Make sure both backend and frontend servers are running
2. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000
3. The SQL learning website will be accessible with all features

ALTERNATIVE METHOD (Using the batch file):
1. Navigate to the main project directory: d:\KRISHNA\VS code\python\MySql Website\react-sql-website
2. Run the batch file: run_both.bat
3. This will start both the backend and frontend automatically
4. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If the backend port 5001 is busy, change it in app.py
- If the frontend port 3000 is busy, it will ask to use another port
- Make sure you have installed all dependencies from requirements.txt and package.json
- If GSAP animations are not working, make sure to install it: npm install gsap
